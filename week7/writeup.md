b. PR Description
> This PR completes Task 1 by extending the API with additional endpoints and strengthening input validation and error handling.
\
Changes include adding DELETE endpoints for notes and action items, introducing shared helpers for pagination, sorting, and blank input validation, and enforcing explicit 400 and 404 error responses for invalid inputs and missing resources. Test coverage was also updated to verify correct delete behavior and error handling.
